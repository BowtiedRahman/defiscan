# Summary

Compound III is an EVM compatible protocol that enables supplying of crypto assets as collateral in order to borrow the base asset. Multiple base assets are supported such as USDC.e, USDC, WETH, and USDT. Accounts can also earn interest by supplying the base asset to the protocol. The market logic of each base asset is implemented in respective `Comet`contracts. Those `Comet`s are deployed by the `Comet Factory` using the `Configurator`. The `Configurator` holds the parameters of each market. A new `Comet` contract needs to be deployed every time the parameters of the market change.

# Overview

## Chain

Compound III is deployed on various chains. This review is based on the Arbitrum chain, an Ethereum L2 in Stage 1 according to L2BEAT.

> Chain score: Medium

## Upgradeability

Compound allors for thr upgrade of contracts. Those upgrades can change the logic and implementation of the markets and governance, which can result in the loss of funds or the loss of unclaimed yield. To prevent this upgrades are regulated by on-chain governance on Ethereum mainnet and can be cancelled by a security council on called `ProposalGuardian`.

Non-malicious upgrades can modify market parameters through the `Configurator` contract, which controls how each market functions. These changes could potentially alter future yield calculations or alter the risk exposue of deposited funds. The system includes a `PauseGuardian` (security council) that can immediately freeze markets if suspicious activity is detected.

Upgrades happen through governance proposal on Ethereum Mainnet. After a 2 days delay a `Bridge Receiver` receives messages from the mainnet governance and sends them to a local `TimeLock` that ensures the transactions are only executed during the correct execution period, after an additional 1 day delay.

## Autonomy

The system has one dependency. The protocol uses Chainlink's oracle to get the price of assets. There are no fallback mechanisms if the oracle fails. It may be replaced only with a contract upgrade through a governance proposal (5+ days delay).

> Autonomy score: Low

## Exit Window

Once an upgrade is approved by the governance on the mainnet there is a total delay of 3 days allowing users to react before the proposal can be executed on Arbitrum. Anyone with more than 25'000 Comp can create a proposal, each proposal has a minimum voting time of 3 days and requires at least 400'000 votes to be valid. A malicious upgrade could hijack user funds if it is not blocked by the `ProposalGuardian`.
In addition to that, the tranfers/deposits/withdrawals can be paused by the `PauseGuardian` (Security Council) with no delay, freezing all assets.

> Exit Window score: High

## Accessibility

The frontend of Compound V3 is open source. Instructions to deploy it locally or deploy it
on IPFS are available [here](https://github.com/compound-finance/palisade). There is no registry
of alternative deployments.

# Technical Analysis

Below is an overview of the contracts from the Compound V3 protocol.

![Overview of the compound protocol](./compound-v3-arbitrum-overview.png)

⚠️ During our analysis, we noticed many of the contract addresses listed in the [official documentation](https://docs.compound.finance/) are out of date. This is most likely explained by the high frequency of updates to the implementation contracts. The list below was last updated on the 20th of February 2025.

A malicious admin could hijack the whole protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Arbitrum TimeLock (Mainnet DAO)                 |
| CometProxyAdmin               | upgrade                               | Triggers the update of either a `Comet (Implementation)` contract or `Configurator (Implementation)` contract. A malicious proposal not stopped by the `ProposerGuardian` could use this function to replace a `Comet (Implementation)` contract and steal funds.                                                                                                                                                                                         | Arbitrum TimeLock (Mainnet DAO)                 |
| CometProxyAdmin               | upgradeAndCall                        | Triggers the update of either a `Comet (Implementation)` contract or `Configurator (Implementation)` contract and calls a function in the new contract. A malicious proposal not stopped by the `ProposerGuardian` could use this function to replace a `Comet (Implementation)` contract and steal funds.                                                                                                                                                | Arbitrum TimeLock (Mainnet DAO)                 |
| CometProxyAdmin               | renounceOwnership                     | Abandons ownership of the contract. The DAO would renounce the access to the administrative functions of the contracts, which includes upgrading the `Comet Implementation` and `Configurator Implementation` contracts. Without other prior adaptations this could present a vulnerability as it would freeze the parameters of the `Comet (Implementation)`contracts.                                                                                   | Arbitrum TimeLock (Mainnet DAO)                 |

This can impact the own TimeLock's settings (change admin, set delays) or interaction with any other contract the DAO has permissions on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ArbitrumBridgeReceiver (Mainnet DAO)            |
| TimeLock                      | cancelTransaction                     | Cancels a pending transaction and removes it from the queue. This allows the DAO to cancel one of its own decision before it is executed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ArbitrumBridgeReceiver (Mainnet DAO)            |
| TimeLock                      | executeTransaction                    | Executes a transaction that was previously queued, if the corresponding delay has passed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Governor (DAO)                                  |

The permissions for all Comet contracts (USDC, WETH, wsETH, USDT, USDS) are similar and therefore only
represented once as `Comet Proxy` and `Comet Implementation`in the table above.

# Security Council

A security council called `Pause Guardian` has the power to pause all deposits, withdrawals, and transfers
in the Arbitrum `Comet` contracts. The guardian is currently a 4/7 multisig made of Compound DAO community members and other trusted entities. The signers are announced [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-multisig-4-of-6-deployment/134/18).
