# Summary

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange based on an Automated Market Maker (AMM), a type of exchange where anyone can pool assets into shared market making strategies.
Uniswap v3 introduces:

- Concentrated liquidity, giving individual LPs granular control over what price ranges their capital is allocated to. Individual positions are aggregated together into a single pool, forming one combined curve for users to trade against

- Multiple fee tiers, allowing LPs to be appropriately compensated for taking on varying degrees of risk

# Overview

## Chain

Uniswap is deployed on Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Base, BNB,
Avalanche C-Chain, CELO, Blast, ZKsync, Zora, and WorldChain. This analysis is
based on the contracts deployed on Ethereum mainnet.

> Chain score: L

## Upgradeability

Uniswap pools are permissionless with anyone being able to swap. Nonetheless the Uniswap DAO
(UNI token holders) can change parameters such as fees through the GorvernorBravoDelegator contract.
Apart from the fees set by the governance, the protocol's contracts are immutable. No party is able to
pause, reverse trade execution, or otherwise change the behavior of the protocol.

Note that a TransparentProxy with the DAO as admin is used for the NonFungibleTokenPositionDescriptor, which is used for token descriptions.
This should not impact the safety of the protocol.

> Upgradeabillity score: M

## Autonomy

There are no particular dependencies for the Uniswap protocol.

## Exit Window

As the contracts are immutable the users can always withdraw their funds, but parameters such as protocol
fees can be changed by the DAO. Propositions can be voted on over the duration of a week, and if a
proposal is approved it can take effect between 2 and 30 days later.

> Exit score: M

## Accessibility

Although there is only a unique official uniswap frontend, Uniswap Labs offers an [open source interface](https://github.com/Uniswap/interface) for all Uniswap protocols. The web app is also hosted on IPFS.

## Dependencies

No external dependency has been found.

## Exit Window

As the contracts are immutable the users can always withdraw their funds, but parameters such as protocol
fees can be changed by the DAO. Timelocks protect the contracts and update are governed by the Governor Bravo contract.
The lock period is at least two days and up to 30 days for governance actions.
When a proposal is created (at least 2.5M Uni), the community can cast their votes during a 3 day voting period. If a majority, and at least 4M votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and may be executed in a minimum of 2 days.
