# Summary

Compound III is an EVM compatible protocol that enables supplying of crypto assets as collateral in order to borrow the base asset. Accounts can also earn interest by supplying the base asset to the protocol.

# Overview

## Chain

The initial deployment of Compound III is on Ethereum mainnet and the base asset is USDC.

Risk: Low

## Upgradeability

The `Comet`s and `Configuration` contracts can be changed at any time with a delay of 2 days once a proposal is accepted. The comet contracts manages all deposits and borrows. A security council can pause the contracts at any time.

Risk: High

## Autonomy

The protocol uses Chainlink's oracle to get the price of the base token. Failure or malicious activity from the oracle may result in users' positions being liquidated.

Risk: High

## Exit Window

Upon upgrade there is a delay of 2 days allowing user to react. Nonetheless
the withdrawals can be paused by a security council with no delay.

Risk: High

## Accessibility

The frontend of Compound V3 is open source. Instructions to deploy it locally or deploy it
on IPFS are available [here](https://github.com/compound-finance/palisade). There is no registry
of alternative deployments.

Risk: Medium

# Security Council

A security council called `Pause Guardian` has the power to pause all deposits, withdrawals, and transfers
in the protocol. The guardian is currently a 4/8 multisig made of Compound DAO community members. The signers are announced [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-multisig-4-of-6-deployment/134/18).
